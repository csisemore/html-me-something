		<p>To say that I have issues focusing is an understatement. As a kid, ADD/ADHD wasn't a thing. Due to my home environment, I was too scared of getting in trouble at school, so I did enough not to. Back then, I read <b>a lot</b>. Reading was always allowed, encouraged even.</p> 
		<p>When I was sixteen, I missed six weeks of school due to illness. After I returned to school, I didn't really care anymore - my algebra teacher gave me only a week to get caught up, which was unfortunate because until then, I loved math.</p>
