			<h4>A bit of background...</h4>
				<p>To say that I have issues focusing is an understatement. As a kid, ADD/ADHD wasn't a thing. Due to my home environment, I was too scared of getting in trouble at school, so I did enough not to. Back then, I read <b>a lot</b>. Reading was always allowed, encouraged even.</p> 
				<p>When I was sixteen, I missed six weeks of school due to illness. After I returned to school, I didn't really care anymore - my algebra teacher gave me only a week to get caught up, which was unfortunate because until then, I loved math. I started to focus more on partying than on my schoolwork, but I kept my grades up.</p>
			<h4>As an adult...</h4>
				<p>In my twenties, after college, I flailed a bit. I moved around, until I finally ended up being back at mom's. Due to her being faculty at the local community college, I went back and took more classes - this time, being older and much more driven, I was able to focus like crazy.</p>
				<p>Once that was finished, I was able to get a good job. After a few yeears, I started noticing that I was having a very hard time tuning out noise. Headphones at work didn't help much. Focusing became much more difficult. I found myself getting distracted in my own head.</p>
				<p>Fast forward a few years, and my employer moved to a new location with an open workspace, and extremely bright lights. My abilty to focus while in the office went straight to hell. Fortunately, they allowed us to work from home a couple of days each week. I was able to get a lot more done on days I worked at home.</p>
			<h4>Discovering the problem...</h4>
				<p>After a car accident a few year later, a CT Scan showed something odd in my brain, and the ER doc suggested getting an MRI to see what it was. When I went to the doctor for the concussion follow-up, he refused to order one. Finally, several months later, when I was having an issue with my left hand & arm, and me telling him that I missed my exit going home (a route I had taken probably a hundred times), he ordered an MRI. </p>
				<p>About two weeks later (before the MRI was scheduled), I completely lost the ability to use my left arm. I went back to the doctor, and he gave me a cortisone shot in my shoulder, and ordered physical therapy for me. The PT was helping, and then one day I had lost all of the progress that I had made. Later that evening, I was at the ER, because I had a stroke. It wasn't discovered then, but that was actually the second stroke.</p>
				<p>The week after getting out of the hospital, I saw my neurologist, and she figured out what was going on. I was referred to a neurosurgeon, and a month later I had brain surgery.</p>
			<h4>The prognosis...</h4>
				<p>I have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moyamoya_disease">moyamoya</a>, and my issues are due to the slow progression of the strokes - mine weren't immediate, really, but I was losing blood flow to parts of the right hemisphere of my brain over a period of about a year.</p>
				<p>After waking up from the surgery, I was immediately able to straighten out my left hand (which was really awesome). However, in the time since, I have had other issues, including ADD (it's odd being diagnosed at this late age). It makes life a bit more difficult, for sure, especially when I compare my abilities now to what they were five years ago.
